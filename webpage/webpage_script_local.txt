Write a Python program.
Use modules opencv and moviepy.
There is one command line argument, call it 'location'.

Make a list of all the .mp4 files in folder 'location'
with durations greater than 15 seconds.

Make an html page
The page background is 25% grey.
All text color on this page is white.
The heading on the html page is 'Clogger Videos'.

Make a table. The table background is 50% grey.

The table has four columns:
 1)- sequence number using two digits, labeled 'Seq'
 2) a jpeg frame taken at 30 seconds into the video; keep these in a folder 'thumb'
 3) duration of the video in format H:MM:SS
 3a) apply shlex.quote() to the .mp4 file name; call this string 'qlink'
 4) Divide the file name into two parts
    at just before the last instance of one of the following strings: '_00.', '_01.', '_02.', '_03.';
    make the first part a link to 'qlink', open this link in a separate tab;
    	 then add a break between the first and second parts.

write the page to a file 'index.html' into 'content' folder.
